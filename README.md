DISCLAIMER: this is for educational purposes only; i do not own seven wonders and this is an emulation only for personal use.

### overview
1. a simple bot that will learn seven wonders and get very good at it.
2. a collection of scripts to analyze the bots behavior and generate human-usable strategies so i can get very good at it.

### roadmap
- build an engine to run seven wonders
- develop a user interface to play the game for testing
- construct a model that can interface with the game engine
- train the model (presumably against itself / replicas)
- test the model by playing with it
- collect some data around how the model behaves
- analyze the data to observe trends that can be exploted for individual play

### practices
- enums and enum values in ALL_CAPS
- classes in PascalCase
- variables and functions in snake_case
